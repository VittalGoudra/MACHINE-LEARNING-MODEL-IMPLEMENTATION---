 ðŸ“Œ PROJECT DESCRIPTION :



This project involves building a predictive machine learning model using **Scikit-learn** to classify or predict outcomes from a given dataset. A commonly used example is **spam email detection**, where the model learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails based on features extracted from the email content. The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline of a machine learning workflowâ€”from data preprocessing to model evaluationâ€”within a **Jupyter Notebook**.




 ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES :




- TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT A SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE  
- TO EXPLORE AND PREPROCESS A REAL-WORLD DATASET  
- TO TRAIN AND EVALUATE A CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING SCIKIT-LEARN  
- TO INTERPRET MODEL PERFORMANCE USING METRICS LIKE ACCURACY, PRECISION, RECALL, AND F1-SCORE  
- TO DOCUMENT THE ENTIRE WORKFLOW IN A JUPYTER NOTEBOOK FOR REVIEW AND CERTIFICATION
